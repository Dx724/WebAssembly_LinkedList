[classes are hoisted] Move class def before performance timing
Load WASM into array buffer before performance timing
Test time to run WASM code both including and excluding compile time
[minimal impact] All scripts: defer
DONE Test LinkedList with thousands of items
DONE Multiple trials
DONE Make new folder for performance testing
DONE Standardize count to 200 million for all tests

Add readme explaining the four types (c, c_optimized, javascript, wasm)
Minified JS
G-zip all source files

README Notes
Comments removed when calculating file sizes
No console.log for performance testing, as is relatively expensive operation
Performance: emcc c.c -o c.js -s ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1
Memory: emcc c.c -o c.js -s ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1 -s MAXIMUM_MEMORY=4GB
Fewer items used for C performance test, as more memory is used --> can use -mx32 compile flag to reach more (though probably slower)
Using fewer items for JS performance test, as memory error occurs
Removing global variable from wasm.wat made time go from 8s->5s
Time to allocate 4GB memory for wasm.js is only about 300 ms
Growing memory in 100 page chunks results in ~33s execution time
Using memory loads instead of a local variable for the WAT code showed only a slight increase in runtime
The time for emscripten_run_script in the C code was measured to be approximately 0.2 milliseconds
Adding compile time to WASM script has minimal effect (under 100 milliseconds)
