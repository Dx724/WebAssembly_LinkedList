Move class def before performance timing
Load WASM into array buffer before performance timing
Test time to run WASM code both including and excluding compile time
All scripts: defer
Test LinkedList with thousands of items
Multiple trials
Make new folder for performance testing

Add readme explaining the four types (c, c_optimized, javascript, wasm)
Minified JS
G-zip all source files

README Notes
Comments removed when calculating file sizes
No console.log for performance testing, as is relatively expensive operation
Performance: emcc c.c -o c.js -s ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1
Removing global variable from wasm.wat made time go from 8s->5s
Time to allocate 4GB memory for wasm.js is only about 300 ms
Growing memory in 100 page chunks results in ~33s execution time
